                We believe time belongs to everyone. Since 1854, no other watchmaker has ever been
                able to match our ability to put a well-crafted watch on your wrist, while leaving
                money in your pocket. Every is a testament to our legendary durability and value,
                and a reminder that time belongs to you.
